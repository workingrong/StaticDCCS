                    Most of our classes are in-person, held at Garnet Valley Middle School Campas
                    on Sundays, serving students from neighboring areas such as Garnet Valley,
                    Wilmington, Chadds Ford, Media, West Chester, and beyond.
                    Our in-person classes include Chinese, Math, Robotics, Art, Music, Sports, and more. 
                    The classes are designed to be fun and interactive, ensuring an engaging learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also offer some classes online, including advanced math courses such as AMC 10 and SAT math,
                    English Reading and Writing, Public Speaking, and more. These online classes are schedules on 
                    on different days from Sunday afternoon to accommodate more students. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have classes for adults and clubs, such as dance, art, and sports.
                    For parents interested in joining any of the lessons, it's a wonderful opportunity
                    to learn somthing new while fostering a sense of community.

                            Public speaking classes are led by Mike Nie, founder of Speak to Lead LLC. 
                            Coach Nie is an award-winning public speaker and a distinguished Toastmaster with 
                            years of experience in teaching public speaking. In each session, students learn 
                            speaking techniques through the analysis of famous speeches. Following each lesson, 
                            students are assigned a 2-3 minute speech as homework, which is presented during 
                            class. Coach Nie provides individualized feedback on each speech, both offline 
                            and in class, to help students refine their skills.
